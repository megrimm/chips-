The idea is to have a Pd library called “chips~” for emulating chips in devices such as Atari, Nintendo, Speak & Spell, etc

This is a really big mess of everything I have collected to create chiptune music in puredata. If you look in _archive/src you will see all the various chips that can be emulated. Most of thiese were grabbed from max/msp and have yet to be ported to puredata. The only ones working right now in Pd are the ones at the root that use pd-lib-builder to build binaries.

If your are interested in continuing please fork at will and I will pull your changes.
