#X text 42 20 The SN76489 Digital Complex Sound Generator (DCSG) is
a TTL-compatible Programmable Sound Generator chip from Texas Instruments.
It contains three square wave tone generators and one white noise generator
\, each of which can produce sounds at various frequencies and sixteen
different volume levels.[1] Its main application has been the generation
of music and sound effects in game consoles \, arcade games and home
computers (such as the BBC Micro and the IBM PCjr) \, existing alongside
the competing and similar General Instrument AY-3-8910. The frequency
of the square waves produced at each channel is derived by two factors:
the speed of the external clock and a value provided in a control register
for that channel (called N). Each channel's frequency is arrived at
by dividing the clock by 32 and then dividing the result by N.;
